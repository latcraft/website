        "description": "Software development has changed. There is no standard database technology to use anymore. If you know SQL perfectly, it will not be sufficient to stay qualified in 2015. This session will explain how to pick the most appropriate database for your next project, reveal common misconceptions about SQL and NoSQL and provide listeners with a rough idea where it is all heading to. The talk is based on personal experience of making the shift from fitting square pegs into round holes to stopping worrying and embracing the change.",
