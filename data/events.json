Thanks to Spock Framework tests/specifications can be written faster in shorter and more readable form. During my talk I will present 7 opinionated reasons why it is worth learning Spock to bring your automatic tests to the next level. This presentation is targeted at Java developers who care about writing automatic tests (all of us?) and for some reasons haven't decided to give Spock a shot yet.",

The reason is that with Retrospectives we\u2019re trying to put together the concept of Kaizen continuous improvement and the leverage of team coaching. In other to take advantage of this powerful idea, powerful skills and maturity are needed both for teams and facilitators. Furthermore, is critical to differentiate between Kaizen and a team coaching process. In this session I\u2019ll start going through both concepts separately: team kaizen and team coaching. The goal is to get the audience understanding more in depth the core concepts behind retrospectives so they can go beyond the ceremony and explore how to evolve their needed competences and retrospective structure to the next level.",
