In this session, we will start by guiding you through the most interesting recent developments in the world of Machine Learning. We will then look at how machines \"learn\" and give you a quick intro into the exciting world of deep neural networks \u2013 perhaps one of the most popular machine learning algorithms today. Finally, we will discuss how you can introduce Machine Learning in your projects.",

Furthermore, is critical to differentiate between Kaizen and a team coaching process. In this session I\u2019ll start going through both concepts separately: team kaizen and team coaching.
